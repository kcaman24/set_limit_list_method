# Set Limit List

  I made the process dynamic by extending the sublist method.
  We may want to split the lists into multiple sublists,
  so I developed the dynamic sublists method.

  ## How does it work
  ```dart
   List<dynamic> myList = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
   final int limit = 2;
   
   var result = setLimitList(myList , limit);
   print(result); // [(0,1),(2,3),(4,5),(6,7)]
  
  ```
